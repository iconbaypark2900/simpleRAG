      "1: Early life Hayao Miyazaki was born on January 5, 1941, in Tokyo City, Empire of Japan, the second of\n",
      "four sons. His father, Katsuji Miyazaki (born 1915), was the director of Miyazaki Airplane, his\n",
      "brother's company, which manufactured rudders for fighter planes during World War II. The business\n",
      "allowed his family to remain affluent during Miyazaki's early life. Miyazaki's father enjoyed\n",
      "purchasing paintings and demonstrating them to guests, but otherwise had little known artistic\n",
      "understanding. He said that he was in the Imperial Japanese Army around 1940; after declaring to his\n",
      "commanding officer that he wished not to fight because of his wife and young child, he was\n",
      "discharged after a lecture about disloyalty. According to Miyazaki, his father often told him about\n",
      "his exploits, claiming that he continued to attend nightclubs after turning 70. Katsuji Miyazaki\n",
      "died on March 18, 1993. After his death, Miyazaki felt that he had often looked at his father\n",
      "negatively and that he had never said anything \"lofty or inspiring\". He regretted not having a\n",
      "serious discussion with his father, and felt that he had inherited his \"anarchistic feelings and his\n",
      "lack of concern about embracing contradictions\".\n",
      "----------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "----------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "2: Miyazaki has noted that some of his earliest memories are of \"bombed-out cities\". In 1944, when he\n",
      "was three years old, Miyazaki's family evacuated to Utsunomiya. After the bombing of Utsunomiya in\n",
      "July 1945, he and his family evacuated to Kanuma. The bombing left a lasting impression on Miyazaki,\n",
      "then aged four. As a child, Miyazaki suffered from digestive problems, and was told that he would\n",
      "not live beyond 20, making him feel like an outcast. From 1947 to 1955, Miyazaki's mother Yoshiko\n",
      "suffered from spinal tuberculosis; she spent the first few years in hospital before being nursed\n",
      "from home. Yoshiko was frugal, and described as a strict, intellectual woman who regularly\n",
      "questioned \"socially accepted norms\". She was closest with Miyazaki, and had a strong influence on\n",
      "him and his later work. Yoshiko Miyazaki died in July 1983 at the age of 72. Miyazaki began school\n",
      "in 1947, at an elementary school in Utsunomiya, completing the first through third grades. After his\n",
      "family moved back to Suginami-ku, Miyazaki completed the fourth grade at Ōmiya Elementary School,\n",
      "and fifth grade at Eifuku Elementary School, which was newly established after splitting off from\n",
      "Ōmiya Elementary. After graduating from Eifuku as part of the first graduating class, he attended\n",
      "Ōmiya Junior High School. He aspired to become a manga artist, but discovered he could not draw\n",
      "people; instead, he only drew planes, tanks, and battleships for several years. Miyazaki was\n",
      "influenced by several manga artists, such as Tetsuji Fukushima, Soji Yamakawa and Osamu Tezuka.\n",
      "Miyazaki destroyed much of his early work, believing it was \"bad form\" to copy Tezuka's style as it\n",
      "was hindering his own development as an artist. Around this time, Miyazaki would often see movies\n",
      "with his father, who was an avid moviegoer; memorable films for Miyazaki include Meshi (1951) and\n",
      "Tasogare Sakaba (1955). After graduating from Ōmiya Junior High, Miyazaki attended Toyotama High\n",
      "School. During his third and final year, Miyazaki's interest in animation was sparked by Panda and\n",
      "the Magic Serpent (1958), Japan's first feature-length animated film in color; he had sneaked out to\n",
      "watch the film instead of studying for his entrance exams. Miyazaki later recounted that he fell in\n",
      "love with the film's heroine, Bai-Niang, and that the film moved him to tears and left a profound\n",
      "impression; he wrote that he was \"moved to the depths of [his] soul\" and that the \"pure, earnest\n",
      "world of the film\" affirmed a side of him that \"yearned desperately to affirm the world rather than\n",
      "negate it\". After graduating from Toyotama, Miyazaki attended Gakushuin University in the department\n",
      "of political economy, majoring in Japanese Industrial Theory. He joined the \"Children's Literature\n",
      "Research Club\", the \"closest thing back then to a comics club\"; he was sometimes the sole member of\n",
      "the club. In his free time, Miyazaki would visit his art teacher from middle school and sketch in\n",
      "his studio, where the two would drink and \"talk about politics, life, all sorts of things\". Around\n",
      "this time, he also drew manga; he never completed any stories, but accumulated thousands of pages of\n",
      "the beginnings of stories. He also frequently approached manga publishers to rent their stories. In\n",
      "1960, Miyazaki was a bystander during the Anpo protests, having developed an interest after seeing\n",
      "photographs in Asahi Graph; by that point, he was too late to participate in the demonstrations.\n",
      "Miyazaki graduated from Gakushuin in 1963 with degrees in political science and economics.\n",
